PROG5 and PROG5-LAB: Software Design with UML and C++

Lab assignments P1:
1 Make a basic stepper motor library and submit it to GitHub classroom
2 Create a UML Use Case diagram with description (see Markdown document) for a sensor application
3 Create a library for a sensor (bring your own or use BMP280) in Arduino in C++
4 Create a library for an i2c sensor or function on a Raspberry Pi in C++
5 Extend the Pi sensor Library to connect and publish to an MQTT broker in C++
6 Create a UML class diagram and sequence diagram for your sensor library
7 Perform Unit test on your Pi sensor library in C++
8 Check your sensor library on DRY, KISS, SOLID and Loose Coupling / Strong Cohesion principles, refactor your code and report which principles you improved on.

OPDRACHT 3: I wrote a library for the bosch BME280 sensor, it works with the Wire library to handle i2c commands.
Written the library based on my work from last year.
